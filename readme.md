Plugin that makes gedit modal

History
=======

In December 2006 Trond Danielsen announced a new plugin for gedit called ViGedit http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gedit-list/2006-December/msg00031.html.

The purpose of this plugin was to provide vi-style keybindings for gedit.

The first move for the plugin was October 2007 http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gedit-list/2007-October/msg00031.html

Then in March 2008, it was moved to Launchpad and taken over by Joseph Method, http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gedit-list/2008-March/msg00029.html

June 2008 I made a branch on launchpad and proceeded to grow vigedit http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~delfick/vigedit/vigedit-additions/revision/7

The project continued to grow for another two years before it essentially stood still.

Since this time, the only things that have happened as far as this project is concerned is Tim Taubert has made a fork on github (https://github.com/ttaubert/ViGedit-Plus) and Gedit 3 has been released.

It is now 2012 and I've been meaning to port this to gedit 3 for quite some time now.....
