Plugin that makes gedit modal

History
=======

In December 2006 Trond Danielsen announced a new plugin for gedit called ViGedit http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gedit-list/2006-December/msg00031.html.

The purpose of this plugin was to provide vi-style keybindings for gedit.

The first move for the plugin was October 2007 http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gedit-list/2007-October/msg00031.html

Then in March 2008, it was moved to Launchpad and taken over by Joseph Method, http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gedit-list/2008-March/msg00029.html

June 2008 I made a branch on launchpad and proceeded to grow vigedit http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~delfick/vigedit/vigedit-additions/revision/7

The project continued to grow for another two years before it essentially stood still.

Since this time, the only things that have happened as far as this project is concerned is Tim Taubert has made a fork on github (https://github.com/ttaubert/ViGedit-Plus) and Gedit 3 has been released.

In 2012 I started to try and port this to Gedit3. I got as far as getting somewhere with making it possible to write tests,
and having those tests run inside an instance of gedit, before other things gained priority and I stopped working on vigedit.

It's now 2013 and I have decided that I won't be porting vigedit to Gedit 3.

I haven't used Gedit itself for a very long time (I use a combination of sublime/idea/vim these days)
and I have come to the conclusion that I don't have the time or motivation to continue this plugin.
