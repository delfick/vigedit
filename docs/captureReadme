To use the capture mode, first you must set the number of next keypresses to be captured.

So enter capture mode ('C' in command mode)
press number of keypresses to capture
then press 'a'

so to capture the next 4 keypresses, then in command mode, type 'C4a'

The statusbar will then reflect this number.


Then everytime you press a key, that event will be added to an array of captured events.

When you want to then "replay" the events, then we go into capture mode and press e

so, from command mode, type 'Ce'


If at any time you want to stop adding keypresses to the capture, then go into capture mode and either press 'c' to clear all that has been captured and restart the capture count, or go into capture mode and press 'a' which will set the capture count to 0.


Notes :
	when you press 'C#a' you will add on to the current capture the number of keypresses as specified by # 
	so if you have already captured 4 keypresses, then when you do 'C2a', the next two keypresses will be added to the capture
