.SH "NAME"
vigedit - Gedit plugins that enables Vi(m)-style key bindings for navigating documents.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
Place the ViGedit distribution files in ~/\.gnome2/gedit/plugins\.
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
ViGedit gives the editor different modes, where each mode assign different actions to particular key combinations\.
.sp
The three main modes are command, insert and visual mode\.
.sp
Command mode can be reached at any point by pressing Escape, all other modes can be accessed via this mode\. Insert mode makes the editor behave like an oridinary editor that doesn"t have modes\. Visual mode makes it so when you move the iter (where text is to be inserted) via keyboard commands, then the text the iter is moved over will be selected\.
.sp
.SS "Using the Commands:"
All actions are activated by a chain of key combinations with the following format:
.PP
\fB<x> <keycombo> <y> <keycombo>\fR
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'Where <x> and <y> are numbers, and a <keycombo> some keys that are pressed (usually a single letter, though can be a single letter with some modifer being pressed (like control)
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'If the action supports it, <x> will be the number of lines the action will apply to
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'If the action is repeatable, <y> will be the number of times the action is repeated on the number of lines specified by <x>
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'The only exception to the above rule is that no action in command mode will select lines, and if they are repeatable, then they will use <x> as the number of times to repeat
.RE
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1

Understanding the following explanations
The following contains the keys that have actions binded to them for each mode\. Note that every binding have 2 flags associated with them, isFinal, isRepeatable\. If isRepeatable is set then that means the action will be repeated, and the accumulator and two number flags will be reset after the action has been repeated the specified number of times if IsFinal is set, then the accumulator and the two flags will be reset after that action has been executed\.
.sp
The following listing of the currently implemented bindings will have a [sfrp] before the binding\. Where each letter represents a different characteristic of the binding, if a letter is not there, then that means that characteristic is false\.
.sp
s means that action selects lines of text (uses <x>)
.sp
f represents the isFinal flag
.sp
r represents the isRepeatable flag (uses <y>)
.sp
p means the action will preserve the position of the iter when it\'s executed\.
