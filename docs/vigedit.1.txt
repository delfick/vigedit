VIGEDIT(1)
==========

NAME
----
vigedit - Gedit plugins that enables Vi(m)-style key bindings for navigating documents.


SYNOPSIS
--------
Place the ViGedit distribution files in ~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins.


DESCRIPTION
-----------
ViGedit gives the editor different modes, where each mode assign different actions to particular key combinations.

The three main modes are command, insert and visual mode. 

Command mode can be reached at any point by pressing Escape, all other modes can be accessed via this mode.
Insert mode makes the editor behave like an oridinary editor that doesn"t have modes.
Visual mode makes it so when you move the iter (where text is to be inserted) via keyboard commands, then the text the iter is moved over will be selected.

Using the Commands:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All actions are activated by a chain of key combinations with the following format:

.<x> <keycombo> <y> <keycombo>
* Where <x> and <y> are numbers, and a <keycombo> some keys that are pressed (usually a single letter, though can be a single letter with some modifer being pressed (like control) 
* If the action supports it, <x> will be the number of lines the action will apply to
* If the action is repeatable, <y> will be the number of times the action is repeated on the number of lines specified by <x> 
* The only exception to the above rule is that no action in command mode will select lines, and if they are repeatable, then they will use <x> as the number of times to repeat 

.Understanding the following explanations
[NOTE]
===============================
The following contains the keys that have actions binded to them for each mode. Note that every binding have 2 flags associated with them, isFinal, isRepeatable.
If isRepeatable is set then that means the action will be repeated, and the accumulator and two number flags will be reset after the action has been repeated the specified number of times
if IsFinal is set, then the accumulator and the two flags will be reset after that action has been executed.

The following listing of the currently implemented bindings will have a [sfrp] before the binding. Where each letter represents a different characteristic of the binding, if a letter is red, then that means that characteristic is true.
s means that action selects lines of text
f represents the isFinal flag
r represents the isRepeatable flag
p means the action will preserve the position of the iter when it's executed.

Common to Visual and Command Modes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    These commands are common to visual and command modes. 
    The only difference is any command that moves the iter, will select the text the iter moves over when in visual mode, and doesn't select text when in command mode.
    
[sfrp]  l::
    Move forward one character ([red]#repeatable#)
    
[sfrp]  h::
    Move backward one character ([red]#repeatable#)
    
[sfrp]  j::
    Move down one line ([red]#repeatable#)
    
[sfrp]  k::
    Move up one line ([red]#repeatable#)
    
[sfrp]  w::
    Move forward one word ([red]#repeatable#)
    
[sfrp]  b::
    Move backward one word ([red]#repeatable#)
    
[sfrp]  G::
    Move the end of the document
    
[sfrp]  $::
    Move the end of the line ([red]#repeatable#)
    
[sfrp]  %::
    Move to the beginning of the line

    Undo last command ([red]#repeatable#)

[sfrp]  I::
    Move the beginning of the line and enter xref:insert[Insert mode]
    
[sfrp]  o::
    Insert a line below the line the iter is currently over and enter xref:insert[Insert mode] ([red]#repeatable#)
    
[sfrp]  O::
    Insert a line above the line the iter is currently over and enter xref:insert[Insert mode] ([red]#repeatable#)
    
[sfrp]  a::
    Move the iter forward one character and enter xref:insert[Insert mode]
    
[sfrp]  /::
    Start a search  
    
[[insert]]
Insert Mode:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Entered into by pressing "i" in command mode 

Selection Mode:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Entered into by selecting some text whilst in command mode
    Once entered into, deselecting the text without modifying said text will return the user to command mode

    Pressing a modifier (control, alt, shift) will not edit the text
    Global shortcuts defined in gedit will still work in this mode

    Pressing any character key whilst in this mode will delete the selection of text, insert the character you just pressed and set the mode to insert mode.

    Pressing Delete or backspace whilst in selection mode will delete only the selected text.
