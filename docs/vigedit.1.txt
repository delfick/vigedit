NAME
----
vigedit - Gedit plugins that enables Vi(m)-style key bindings for navigating documents.


SYNOPSIS
--------
Place the ViGedit distribution files in ~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins.


DESCRIPTION
-----------
ViGedit gives the editor different modes, where each mode assign different actions to particular key combinations.

The three main modes are command, insert and visual mode. 

Command mode can be reached at any point by pressing Escape, all other modes can be accessed via this mode.
Insert mode makes the editor behave like an oridinary editor that doesn"t have modes.
Visual mode makes it so when you move the iter (where text is to be inserted) via keyboard commands, then the text the iter is moved over will be selected.

ViGedit supports the following key bindings for the following modes :

Global to all modes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Esc::
	Switch to command mode.

Insert Mode:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selection Mode:

Entered into by selecting some text whilst in command mode
Once entered into, deselecting the text without modifying said text will return the user to command mode

Pressing a modifier (control, alt, shift) will not edit the text
Global shortcuts defined in gedit will still work in this mode

Pressing any character key whilst in this mode will delete the selection of text, insert the character you just pressed and set the mode to insert mode.
