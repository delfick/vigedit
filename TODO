ViGedit TODO
============

TODO:
* Make the statusbar a list (so bindings can be activated via mouse clicks)
* Make a search mode that implements a regex search and replace similar to s/<search>/<replace>/<options> in expression mode
* Make it possible to save and restore captures in Capture Mode
* Implement the ability to have many clipboards



Bugs:
-----
* s/<search>/<replace>/<options> in expression mode doesn't highlight found items
